I always thought it was ok
I have so strange ideals today
You know I love you, it's not that
It is this emptiness inside

I need your love
I need you to stay
Don't walk away again, I need to know you care
I need your love

I never told you I was sad
I didn't know it was just that
There's nothing wrong on what you did
But when you're kid pain hides so deep

I need your love
I need you to stay
Don't walk away again, and show me that you care
I need your love
I feel alone

When I was brave I got a kiss
But love is not a prize to give
And when the things became so wild
I ask myself who was the child

And I need your love
I need you to stay
Don't walk away again, and show me that you care
I need your love
I need your love
I need you to stay
It was me who had to stay and bring him to bed
And I still remember all the things he said
